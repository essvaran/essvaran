## SUMMARY
- 4+ years of end-to-end experience in the full software development life cycle (SDLC), from requirement analysis and architecture design to coding, testing, deployment, and post-production support across diverse client projects.  
- Strong expertise in **C# and .NET Core/.NET 6**, with a focus on building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web applications and microservices.  
- Designed and implemented **RESTful Web APIs and microservices**, applying **CQRS pattern with MediatR** for separation of commands and queries, improving maintainability, performance, and scalability of backend services.  
- Hands-on experience in **API Gateway integration using Ocelot** to centralize routing, rate limiting, caching, and request aggregation across distributed microservices.  
- Built efficient data access layers using **Entity Framework Core** and optimized database interactions with **SQL Server** (stored procedures, indexes, query optimization).  
- Practiced **SOLID principles** and **Clean Architecture** with Dependency Injection and design patterns such as **Repository, Unit of Work, and CQRS**.  
- Implemented robust logging and exception handling using **Serilog** and middleware pipelines, improving system observability and reliability.  
- Integrated **Azure Blob Storage** for secure, scalable document management (upload, download, lifecycle management).  
- Integrated **distributed caching using Redis** to improve application performance, reduce database load, and enhance scalability of frequently accessed data.  
- Skilled in frontend development with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and modern frameworks/libraries including **Angular, Next.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery**, delivering responsive and interactive UIs.  
- Experienced in **state management with Zustand** in Next.js applications for cleaner and predictable client-side data flow.  
- Focused on **application security**, implementing authentication and authorization (**JWT, OAuth2**), along with encryption strategies to protect sensitive data.
